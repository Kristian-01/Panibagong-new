STAFF ORDER MANAGEMENT SYSTEM DEMONSTRATION

This system allows staff to manage orders through the complete lifecycle:

1. PENDING → PROCESSING → SHIPPED → DELIVERED

HOW IT WORKS:

1. STAFF VIEWS ORDERS:
   - Staff opens "Order Management" from menu
   - Sees all orders with current status
   - Can filter by status, search by order number, etc.

2. STAFF ACTIONS:
   - For PENDING orders: Click "Start Processing" button
   - For PROCESSING orders: Click "Mark as Shipped" button  
   - For SHIPPED orders: Click "Mark as Delivered" button

3. REAL-TIME UPDATES:
   - Customer immediately sees status change in their app
   - Push notifications sent for status updates
   - Order tracking shows current progress

4. STATUS VALIDATION:
   - Only valid status transitions allowed
   - Pending → Processing (✅)
   - Processing → Shipped (✅)
   - Shipped → Delivered (✅)
   - Invalid transitions blocked (❌)

EXAMPLE USAGE:

// Staff starts processing a pending order
final result = await OrderService.startProcessing(orderId);
if (result['success']) {
  // Order status changed from 'pending' to 'processing'
  // Customer immediately sees "Processing" status
  // Staff can now work on the order
}

// Staff marks order as shipped
final result = await OrderService.markAsShipped(orderId);
if (result['success']) {
  // Order status changed from 'processing' to 'shipped'
  // Customer sees "Shipped" status
  // Order is ready for delivery
}

// Staff marks order as delivered
final result = await OrderService.markAsDelivered(orderId);
if (result['success']) {
  // Order status changed from 'shipped' to 'delivered'
  // Customer sees "Delivered" status
  // Order is complete
}

FEATURES:

✅ Real-time status updates
✅ Status validation and security
✅ Staff dashboard with statistics
✅ Order filtering and search
✅ Detailed order information
✅ Mobile-responsive interface
✅ Error handling and validation
✅ Activity logging (can be added)

SECURITY:

✅ Authentication required for all operations
✅ Staff can only update orders they have access to
✅ Status transitions validated on backend
✅ API endpoints protected with middleware

This system provides a complete workflow for staff to efficiently manage orders
while keeping customers informed of their order progress in real-time.
